description: |
  Subworkflow to perform registration between a moving and a fixed image (e.g. T1 -> DWI).
  It requires as input at least a moving (ch_image) and a reference (ch_ref) image to properly
  perform registration.

  Output transformations curated for images for use with the REGISTRATION_ANTSAPPLYTRANSFORMS module
  are available under the names `forward_image_transform` and `backward_image_transform`. The same lists
  are also available for tractograms (`forward_tractogram_transform` and `backward_tractogram_transform`).
  However, to use the REGISTRATION_TRACTOGRAM module, you have to use the `backward_affine` and `backward_warp`
  channels provided by this subworkflow.

  Registration suites:
  - EasyReg (ML): params.run_easyreg = true

    module: REGISTRATION_EASYREG

    Run freesurfer EasyReg any-to-any modality registration.

    NOTE: Outputs a combined warp field only, no affine transformations are available. CANNOT BE LINKED WITH THE BUNDLE_SEG SUBWORKFLOW.

  - Synthmorph (ML): params.run_synthmorph = true

    module: REGISTRATION_SYNTHMORPH

    Run SynthMorph any-to-any modality registration. By default, the algorithm is configured to
    run a chain of affin+deformable transformations, making it suitable for use with most modules
    and subworkflows like BUNDLE_SEG.

    NOTE: the output affine transformation file is in .lta format and needs to be converted to .mat to be used with ANTs using the REGISTRATION_CONVERT module.

  - ANTs (SyN+SyN Quick): params.run_easyreg = false && params.run_synthmorph = false

    module: REGISTRATION_ANTS or REGISTRATION_ANATTODWI

    Run ANTs registration using antsRegistrationSyN.sh (quick version also available).

    NOTE : Transformation to DWI space is available. To trigger it, supply a metric file (ch_metric) in DWI space (e.g. FA map) in addition to the moving (ch_image) and reference (ch_ref) images.
